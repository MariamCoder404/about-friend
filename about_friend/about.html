        <pre>
    My close friend,<b> Maya Khalid</b>, is from the Maldives. Although we are not close in distance, our friendship 
    is incredibly strong. She studied <b>nursing </b>and is passionate about<b> coding, cooking new recipes, and 
    learning about other countries and cultures</b>.

    Our first conversation began on<b> June 22, 2024</b>, when I sent her an e-letter in English. From that
     moment, our connection grew rapidly. We started sharing and exchanging a lot about our countries, 
     cultures, habits, and daily routines. Over time, we even began sharing our personal struggles, especially 
     during exams and academic responsibilities, always supporting and encouraging each other through the tough times.
